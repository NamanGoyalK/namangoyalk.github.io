# My Portfolio â€“ Built with Flutter

Excited to finally share my **portfolio**, built from the ground up using **Flutter**!

Over the past few months, Iâ€™ve been deep-diving into:

* ðŸŽ¨ UI/UX Design & Visual Aesthetics
* ðŸ§± Clean Architecture
* ðŸ”™ Backend Integration
* ðŸš€ Deployment & Optimization

This portfolio isnâ€™t just a showcase of polished screens â€” it reflects my **process, decisions, and the challenges** I tackled along the way. From raw wireframes to refined visuals, every part tells a story.
